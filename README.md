Hi Team at DeltaX,
  This is My spotify web app with Basic CRUD and songs listens as per the assessment required me to make.
  Straight away i'd like to mention that i have used Spring MVC to Develop this webapp, the reason being my familiarity with java and spring framework.
  i have made use of MVC architecture as much as possible. Also as of now (08-06-2022, 12 am) i have done most of the task assigned in the assessment detailed except 
  the validations,which i would get into tomorrow.
 
Here in this Readme file i'll attach screenshots as well as important queries and business logic.
